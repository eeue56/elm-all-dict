{-| A dictionary mapping unique keys to values. This dictionary can use any type as a key.
In the core-provided Dict, keys can only be comparable.

AllDict allows you to provide a custom operation for hashing keys. The ord function has a type signature of `k -> comparable`.

It's possible to define the ord function in such a way that AllDict can actually function as a DefaultDict.

An example of this might be

```
ord : Action -> Int
ord action =
  case action of
    Run -> 0
    Hide -> 1
    StandStill -> 2
    _ -> 3
```

This will default any Action in the dictionary to 3. You can then set a default like so:

```

myDict : AllDict Action String Int
myDict =
  AllDict.fromList
    ord
    [(Noop, "Do nothing")]

-- equal to `"Do nothing"`
-- as `ord` maps anything outside of Run, Hide, StandStill
-- to the same hash
eat =
  myDict |>
    AllDict.get Eat

```

Insert, remove, and query operations all take *O(log n)* time. AllDictionary
equality with `(==)` is unreliable and should not be used. Instead, use AllDict.eq for element-wise comparisons,
and AllDict.fullEq for a full comparison

-- This is a hack
-- As AllDict uses types with the same names as those used
-- internally by Elm-Core's Dict, when the runtime tries to
-- shortcut and pretty-print the Dict (as the ctor of the
-- objects match), it will cause an error if Dict has not been
-- imported at least somewhere in the program.
-- So, we import it here - and get prettyprinting for free!
