{-| A dictionary mapping unique keys to values. This dictionary can use any type as a key.
In the core-provided Dict, keys can only be comparable.

This little dictionary is hacky. It uses a custom toString as a hashing function - so don't use it on
any types which have non-unique representations in strings! At the moment, it has custom support for converting functions into keys.

It's hard to imagine many cases where you would want a function as a key, but it's now possible.

Insert, remove, and query operations all take *O(log n)* time. EveryDictionary
equality with `(==)` is unreliable and should not be used.

-- This is a hack
-- As EveryDict uses types with the same names as those used
-- internally by Elm-Core's Dict, when the runtime tries to
-- shortcut and pretty-print the Dict (as the ctor of the
-- objects match), it will cause an error if Dict has not been
-- imported at least somewhere in the program.
-- So, we import it here - and get prettyprinting for free!
